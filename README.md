# inpainting

Goal of inpainting is to complete sinograms (radon transforms) as acquired from computer tomographic (CT) imaging. The desired sinograms need to be completed since we aim at reducing the number of projections and therefore to effectively reduce the dose from x-rays that a patient  would be exposed to.
